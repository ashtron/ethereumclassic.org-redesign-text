# What is a blockchain?
Put simply a blockchain is a way to keep tracking of digitized value without the need of a bank or other institution.

# What is ETC?
ETC (or Ethereum Classic) is a blockchain and Cryptocurrency that takes digitized value further. Rather than just allowing people to send value to each other ETC allows them to create more complex contracts between each other that operate autonomously. This is a rather hard concept to grasp at first but for the time being imagine that Bitcoin is a landline phone, it does one thing very well, makes phone calls, and ETC is a smart phone, it is simply capable of much more.

ETC is also several other things:
* It is a fair and open community
* It is a blockchain with a long history of operation
* It is a blockchain where all transactions are permanent, if someone sends you ETC it is yours forever
* The future of IoT blockchain applications

# Why ETC?
Blockchains are many things, they are technology, community, and many times they are also Cryptocurrency. ETC is a Cryptocurrency and as such it's important that we take our role seriously and know what our limits are.

## Immutability
ETC is a Cryptocurrency where your accounts are never changed by others. This is a philosophy we share with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and others.

Other blockchains take a different philosophy which they sometimes call "governance", and they allow the participants of the blockchain to vote with their economic power on the account balances of others. Imagine if all the members of your bank believed you broke a law, rather than going to the police the largest bank accounts voted to take your money away.

## Technology
ETC does highly efficient value transfers (more so than Bitcoin and its variants), it is focusing on IoT, and runs a mathematically verified EVM. What this all means is that ETC is great at what it sets out to do: be a highly efficient means of exchange that connects the world's devices.

IoT is under active development but will be available later this year.

## Community
Many blockchain communities have a centralized leadership, they have a few people at the top who make the decisions for everyone else. ETC's community is purposely structured to avoid this, responsibility for different parts of the community, and development, are diffused between many parties. This prevents the biased "governance" that blockchains can easily become prone to.
